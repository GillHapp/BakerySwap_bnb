# BakerySwap - Decentralized Exchange on Binance Smart Chain

AquaDex is a cutting-edge **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** protocol designed and deployed on the **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**. AquaDex aims to provide a seamless and decentralized platform for adding liquidity to a pool containing the **BNB** (native token) and **DBNB** (derived token) pair, as well as enabling users to easily swap between these two tokens. AquaDex empowers liquidity providers (LPs) by rewarding them with a share of the platform‚Äôs transaction fees in exchange for their liquidity, ensuring a dynamic and efficient DeFi ecosystem.

## üåê Overview

**AquaDex** is a fully decentralized exchange protocol that utilizes an **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** to allow token swaps and liquidity provision. It is designed for users to interact with **BNB** (the native token) and **DBNB** (a derivative token) on the **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**. AquaDex enables users to add liquidity to a pool, swap tokens, and remove liquidity‚Äîall in a trustless, permissionless, and secure environment.

By providing liquidity to the **BNB/DBNB** pool, users contribute to the overall health of the decentralized exchange while earning rewards. AquaDex offers a fast, efficient, and cost-effective way for users to engage with DeFi applications on the Binance Smart Chain.

### Core Features:
- **Add Liquidity**: Users can add liquidity to the pool by depositing **BNB** and **DBNB** tokens in equal amounts. Liquidity providers receive LP tokens as proof of their contribution.
- **Remove Liquidity**: Users can withdraw their liquidity and receive back a proportional share of **BNB** and **DBNB** tokens.
- **Token Swap**: Users can perform token swaps between **BNB** and **DBNB** tokens at market prices set by the liquidity pool.
- **Binance Smart Chain Compatibility**: AquaDex is deployed on the **Binance Smart Chain**, enabling users to interact with the platform using the native blockchain without incurring high fees.

## üí° Features

- **üíß Add Liquidity to the Pool**: Liquidity providers can deposit equal amounts of **BNB** and **DBNB** tokens, adding liquidity to the platform. In return, they receive LP tokens representing their share of the pool.
- **‚ùå Remove Liquidity**: Liquidity providers can withdraw their liquidity and get a proportional share of **BNB** and **DBNB** tokens based on their share in the pool.
- **üîÑ Token Swap**: Swap between **BNB** and **DBNB** tokens with instant execution. The price is automatically set based on the liquidity pool.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Binance Smart Chain Integration**: AquaDex works seamlessly with the **Binance Smart Chain**, allowing users to test and interact with the protocol without spending real funds.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with **AquaDex**, follow the steps below to set up the development environment, install dependencies, and interact with the protocol.

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed:

1. **Node.js**: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended version: LTS).
2. **Metamask**: [Install Metamask](https://metamask.io/) - this wallet will interact with Ethereum-compatible blockchains, including **Binance Smart Chain**.
3. **Binance Smart Chain Configuration**: Add the **Binance Smart Chain** network to your Metamask wallet. Use the provided RPC and chain ID for the mainnet or testnet.

### üì¶ Installation

To set up AquaDex locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GillHapp/BakerySwap_bnb.git
   cd BakerySwap_bnb
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### üèÉ Running the Project

To run the AquaDex project locally:

1. Ensure that your Metamask wallet is connected to the **Binance Smart Chain** network.
2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the AquaDex platform.

## üìú Smart Contracts

The AquaDex decentralized exchange relies on two main smart contract functions: **addLiquidity** and **removeLiquidity**. These smart contracts manage the liquidity pool and facilitate token swaps, ensuring a trustless, transparent, and decentralized environment.

### ‚ûï Liquidity Add Function

The **addLiquidity** function allows users to deposit **BNB** and **DBNB** tokens into the liquidity pool. Liquidity providers receive LP tokens as a representation of their share in the pool.

```solidity
function addLiquidity(uint256 _dxfiAmount) external payable returns (bool) {
    require(_dxfiAmount > 0, "Amount should be greater than zero");
    uint256 _ethAmount = calculateRequiredEthForLiquidity(_dxfiAmount);
    require(msg.value >= _ethAmount, "Insufficient ETH provided for liquidity");
    
    // Add liquidity logic
    liquidityPool[_msgSender()] += _dxfiAmount;
    totalSupply += _dxfiAmount;
    return true;
}
```

### ‚ûñ Liquidity Remove Function

The **removeLiquidity** function enables liquidity providers to withdraw their liquidity from the pool. Upon withdrawal, the user will receive the proportional amount of **BNB** and **DBNB** tokens.

```solidity
function removeLiquidity(uint256 _amount) public returns (uint256, uint256) {
    require(_amount > 0, "Amount should be greater than zero");

    uint256 _reservedEth = address(this).balance;
    uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();
    uint256 _ethAmount = (_reservedEth * _amount) / _totalSupply;
    uint256 _tokenAmount = (getTokensInContract() * _amount) / _totalSupply;

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(_ethAmount);
    ERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, _tokenAmount);

    return (_ethAmount, _tokenAmount);
}
```
